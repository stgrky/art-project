      <h2>VERSE 1A</h2>
      <p>
        Do you love me?
        <br />
        Like I love you, I’d sure like to know
        <br />
        Darlin’ be patient
        <br />
        As I walk down this road
      </p>

      <h2>VERSE 1B</h2>
      <p>
        You’re my lady, I want to treat you
        <br />
        Like you deserve to be
        <br />
        In time, I’ll earn your trust
        <br />
        Please confide in me
      </p>

      <h2>CHORUS</h2>
      <p>
        I hurt you, I’m sorry
        <br />
        I inflicted my pain
        <br />
        (choppy phrases) It kills me.. to see your.. "Blue Eyes Crying In the
        Rain" (extra measure with steely to give some breath)
        <br />
        Give me your hand and, I promise you’ll see
        <br />
        I’ll earn your heart, confide in me
      </p>

      <h2>VERSE 2A</h2>
      <p>
        I still love you
        <br />
        Do you love me? I want to know
        <br />
        Will you let me, hold you closer
        <br />
        As we walk down this road
      </p>

      <h2>VERSE 2B</h2>
      <p>
        It’s just us now, my darling
        <br />
        Forever we’ll be
        <br />
        Forever together
        <br />
        You can confide in me
      </p>

      <h2>CHORUS</h2>
      <p>
        I hurt you, I’m sorry
        <br />
        I inflicted my pain
        <br />
        (choppy phrases) It kills me.. to see your.. "Blue Eyes Crying In the
        Rain" (extra measure with steely)
        <br />
        Give me your hand and, I promise you’ll see
        <br />
        I’ll earn your heart…(extra measure-ish, slow down tempo, tittle on the
        hihat a lil bit, maybe a chime for outro)... if you confide in me
        (choral backup vocal uprise like in “I’m a Ramblin’ Man” by Waylon on
        the lines where he says “you’re standin’ to close to the
        flaaayyyyyyyyymeeee)
      </p>

      <p>Yes I’ll earn your heart, you can confide in me</p>
